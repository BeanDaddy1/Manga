  "description": "From the author of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san comes another sweet couple's comedy about Tanaka Ayumu, a first year high school student who is secretly in love with his senior, the president of the unofficial Shogi club, Yaotome Urushi. Tanaka vows to confess his feelings to Yaotome after he manages to defeat her in a game of shogi, but he's a beginner at the game and Yaotome always beats him. Meanwhile, she keeps trying to get Tanaka to admit his feelings, but he rarely allows his poker face to slip.\n\nThough the day of his victory is still nowhere to be seen, this is the story in which he may ‘checkmate’ her by other means.",
